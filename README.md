# Regex-Equality
Theory of automata and formal languages Project
This small project gets two Regular expressions and check if they are accepting a same language or not.
This process works with several steps included:  
**1-** Create a Regex Tree based on the input Regex.  
**2-** Create an NFA base on the Regex Tree.  
**3-** Create a DFA based on the NFA.  
**4-** Minimize the DFA and check.  
**5-** Check equality of MDFAs for both REs.
